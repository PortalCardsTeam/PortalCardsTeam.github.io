Portals Cards aims to be a cornerstone of the Portal Learning experience, at the intersection of self-directed and career-connected learning. As a prototypal product, it can still be elevated in terms of design, UX, and engagement. Ultimately, the Cards will continuously evolve to become a respected micro-credential that indicates on proficiency of soft-skills. In the current version of the project, there are 10 fully fleshed out Cards derived from the America Succeeds Durable Skills framework. Every Card is a piece of a more complete skill; mastery of all 5 sub-skills indicates mastery of the entire skill.
In this incarnation of the Portal Cards project, our team was tasked not with the development of Portal Cards, but with its testing. After performing an internal test in which we all completed a single Card, we have come to youâ€”Portal Learners.
The product that you will be testing today is a barebones scaffold of the Portal Cards hosted in Circle. Please press the blue button below to onboard onto Portal Cards. If you ever have any questions or concerns regarding navigation, exit this screen and click the pink "TUTORIAL" page.
